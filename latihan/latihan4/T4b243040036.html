          Valorant is a 2020 first-person tactical hero shooter video game
          developed and published by Riot Games. The free-to-play game is
          inspired by the Counter-Strike series, borrowing some mechanics such
          as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy when moving.

          When Riot Games decided to expand its portfolio into the competitive
          tactical shooter space, it wasn’t doing so lightly. Valorant,
          originally codenamed “Project A”, officially launched in June of 2020.
          Its build up to being fully out in the wild was relatively short
          compared to a lot of other competitive titles (it was first teased in
          late 2019), but such was the confidence the gaming and esports giant
          had in its tilt on the genre. And while comparisons to Blizzard’s
          Overwatch were thick and fast in the early days (and are even still
          now, erroneously), there’s a sense that the tactical side of Valorant
          is more akin to Counter Strike than its more colourful competitor.
          This tactical lean has given Valorant a mature edge over all of its
          contemporaries, with many professional players preferring it in the
          crowded space -- a sentiment that seeps into an edgier, more
          underground pathway for younger players looking to not only cut their
          teeth on the tactical shooter market, but to also solidify themselves
          and their skills in the more refined game.Naturally, after launch and
          being a Riot Games game, it didn’t take long for Valorant to get to
          the so-called ‘pro circuit’ in the world of esports with the Riot
          Games-run Valorant Champions Tour (VCT) considered the peak of the
          game’s competitive mountain. However, as you might already get from
          this article, other Valorant tourneys take place across different
          tiers, and the scene(s) for the game in this space are a constant for
          growth. In 2021 Red Bull took the initiative to create something of a
          launching pad for amateur players, working with colleges and
          universities around the world to craft the Red Bull Campus Clutch
          esports series, which is now in its third year.

          Valorant itself has various game modes, one of which is
          competitive.Competitive matches are the same as unranked matches with
          the addition of a win-based ranking system that assigns a rank to each
          player after 5 games are played. Players are required to reach level
          20 before playing this mode.In July 2020, Riot introduced a "win by
          two" condition for competitive matches, where instead of playing a
          single sudden death round at 12-12, teams will alternate playing
          rounds on attack and defense in overtime until a team claims victory
          by securing a two-match lead. Each overtime round gives players the
          same amount of money to purchase guns and abilities, as well as
          approximately half of their ultimate ability charge. After each group
          of two rounds, players may vote to end the game in a draw, requiring 6
          players after the first set, 3 after the second, and thereafter only 1
          player to agree to a draw. The competitive ranking system ranges from
          Iron to Radiant. Every rank except for Radiant has 3 tiers.Radiant is
          reserved for the top 500 players of a region, and both Immortal and
          Radiant have a number associated to their rank allowing players to
          have a metric in which they can compare how they rank up to others at
          their level.
